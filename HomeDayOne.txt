Collection

A single database is allowed to store multiple collections.

Doesn't contain $, empty string, null character and doesnt begin with system.

MongoDB -> data records are stored as BSON documents.

BSON -> binary representration of JSON documents. Maximum size is 16 MB.
Ensures that the single document does not use too much amount of RAM or
bandwidth(during transmission). 

BSON contains more data types as compared to JSON.

_id field name is reserved to use as a primary key, value of this field must
be unique, immutable, and can be of any type other than an array.
cannot contain null characters.

Important

When you create a collection MongoDB automatically creates a unique index on the _id field.

The _id field is the first field of every document

The value of the _id field can be of any BSON type except arrays.

The default value of the _id field is ObjectId.
